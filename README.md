## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , Vaishak here.

This account is dedicated to arts with code. Also I maintain Web dev related notes here which I will be documenting frequently. Have also added a section dedicated to mini projects which will be a better way to kill one's time from scrolling through social media.

This is my second profile. Do visit [vaishak10](https://github.com/vaishak10) which is my main account where I will be committing a wide range of UI screens and applications using wide range of technologies.
